This is a simple web server that can be used to serve content.
The server is live reload and does not need to be restarted every time a change is made, simply refresh the page.

To get started:

1. clone from github or download and extract the zip
2. navigate to directory with this project and run [ npm install ] to install the dependencies needed
3. to start the server run [  npm start ]
4. Navigate to localhost:3000


Note:

if more than the index.html page is added the route would be localhost:3000/that_page.html
      - for example: localhost:3000/about.html
when a change is made to code, refresh the browser
